![An accurate representation of myself.](/img/sebs-by-stella_small.png)

I am a scientist, educator, and science communicator based in Pittsburgh, PA. I study the complex relationship between animalsâ€™ eyes, their environment, and how they use color, shape, and movement to communicate. In particular, I am interested in how jumping spiders get their audience's attention when performing their spectacular courtship dances. My favorite part of science is sharing it with others through formal and informal teaching, science writing, social media, and outreach events. 

I was born in Colombia, and grew up in Forest Hills, NYC. In 2013, I earned a dual B.S. in Biology and Applied Physics at the University of Miami. Currently, I am a PhD student in the [Richards-Zawacki Lab](http://www.rzlab.pitt.edu) at the University of Pittsburgh. In my free time, I enjoy video games, hiking, and wildlife photography. While I love all animals, there is a special spot in my heart for spiders and other arachnids, and I keep a small collection of arachnids that join me in my educational programs.
