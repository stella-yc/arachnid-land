![An accurate representation of myself.](/img/sebs-by-stella_small.png)

I am a scientist and educator based in Pittsburgh, PA. I study the complex relationship between animals’ eyes, their environment, and how they use color, shape, and movement to communicate. While I love all animals, there is a special spot in my heart for spiders and other arachnids. 

I was born in Colombia, and grew up in Forest Hills, NYC. In 2013, I earned a B.S. in Biology and Applied Physics at the University of Miami. Currently, I am a PhD student in the [Richards-Zawacki Lab](http://www.rzlab.pitt.edu) at the University of Pittsburgh. 

In my free time, I enjoy video games, hiking, and wildlife photography. Recently, I have been trying to learn natural history illustration. I also keep a small collection of arachnids that join me in my educational programs.
