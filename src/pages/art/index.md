You can find up-to-date examples of my [spider photography here](https://adobe.ly/2pfbiqL). (I have a [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/saecheverri/), but I haven't used it in ages, and am in the process of moving hostings).

For macro photography, I use a Nikon D7500 body, a set of Kenko extension tubes for macro shots, and either a Nikon 18-55mm or 50-200mm lens. For larger subjects, I use a Tamron 16-300mm telephoto.

If you are interested in macro photography, but are on a budget, there are very decent clip-on macro lenses for your smartphone available on Amazon. Search "clip-on macro lens" - usually they are ~10-15$ dollars.
