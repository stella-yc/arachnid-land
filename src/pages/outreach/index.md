## Science is for everyone, and so are spiders.



I am passionate about engaging the public in science and nature. Two of my main goals as an educator are to (1) show that science is for anyone, regardless of background or skin color, and (2) teach that insects and arachnids, while sometimes scary, are beautiful animals worthy of our attention and respect. 



I have brought my outreach arachnids to the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, Phipps Conservatory & Botanical Gardens, Pittsburgh Children's Museum, local schools, and even helped put on a spider dance show at the [Wood Street Art Gallery](http://woodstreetgalleries.org/portfolio-view/all-around-us/). I've also designed and run several after-school events with Assemble PGH, a non-profit aimed at serving students from underprivileged neighborhoods, including a four-part series on animal and human senses. If you are in the Pittsburgh area and are interested in having me visit your institution to talk about spiders, vision, and/or science at large, please get in touch! I am also available for remote classroom visits via Skype-a-Scientist.
