You can find more of my photography on my [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/saecheverri/). I use a Nikon D3100 body, a Tamron 16-300mm lens, and a set of Kenko extension tubes for macro shots. 

If you are interested in macro photography, but are on a budget, there are very decent clip-on macro lenses for your smartphone available on Amazon. Search "clip-on macro lens" - usually they are ~10-15$ dollars.
